## About

Welcome to my site I'm glad to see you visit​ed​ me. I’​m​ a full stack developer based in ​A​tlanta. I​’m​ experienced in multiple web technologies including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.JS GraphQL & PostgresQL. I enjoy bringing my ideas to life through code. I recently graduated
from DigitalCrafts bootcamp in Atlanta and I’m looking for employment. I would like to add my passion for development started in my early years, I am a hardware geek, I have been building computers since I was 11 years old.​ From this day forward,​ I started to get very interested in all things technoloy. Today I am happy to finally become a software developer & I am ready to begin my journey in the field.
