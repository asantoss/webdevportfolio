## About

Welcome to my site I'm glad to see you visit me. I am a full stack developer based in atlanta. I am experienced
in multiple web technologies including HTML/CSS,Javascript,React,Node GraphQL & PostgresQL. I enjoy bringing my ideas to life through code. I recently graduated from Digital Crafts bootcamp
in Atlanta and I am looking for employment. I would like to add my passion with development started in my early years, I am a
hardware geek, I have been building computers since I was 11 years old. Since that day I started to get very interested
in all things technoloy. Today I am happy to finally become a software developer & I am ready to begin my journey in the field.
